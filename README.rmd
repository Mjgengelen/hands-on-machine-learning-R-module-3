<br>
`r emo::ji("clock")` From 9.00 am to 12.00 pm or from 1.30 pm to 4.30 pm
<br>
`r emo::ji("location")` online, organized by Capgemini Academy and Nationale Nederlanden

Course materials will be posted in the week before the workshop. You are now on the landing page for **Module 3: neural networks**.

## Prework

<p align="justify">The workshop requires a basic understanding of R. A good starting level is the material covered in the [werkt-U-al-met-R?](https://github.com/katrienantonio/werkt-U-al-met-R) 
repo on Katrien's GitHub.</p>

Familiarity with statistical or machine learning methods is *not* required. The workshop gradually builds up these concepts, with an emphasis on hands-on demonstrations and exercises.

The R and RStudio software should be up and running before coming to the workshop. Please visit the **Software requirements** posted below.

## Overview

<p text-align="justify"> This workshop introduces the *essential concepts of building machine learning models with R*. Throughout the workshop you will gain insights in the foundations of machine learning methods, including *resampling methods*, *data preprocessing steps* and the *tuning of parameters*. You will cover a variety of *statistical and machine learning methods*, ranging from GLMs, over tree-based machine learning methods to neural networks. You will acquire insights in the foundations of these methods, learn how to set-up the model building process, and focus on building a good understanding of the resulting model output and predictions.</p> 

<p align="justify">Leaving this workshop, you should have a firm grasp of the working principles of a variety of machine learning methods and be able to explore their use in practical settings. Moreover, you should have acquired the fundamental insights to explore some other methods on your own.</p> 

## Schedule and Course Material

##### Module 3: Neural networks

In two sessions we cover: 

- R and Python toolbox 
- tensors and operations on tensors
- basics of feed-forward artificial neural networks
- an architecture with layers in {keras}
- loss function, forward pass and backpropagation
- performance metrics
- claim frequency and severity modelling with neural networks
- auto encoders
- convolutional neural networks.

## Software Requirements

You have **two options** to join the coding exercises covered during the
workshop. Either you join the RStudio cloud workspace dedicated to the
workshop, and then you'll run R in the cloud, from your browser. Or you
use your local installation of R and RStudio.

We kindly ask participants to **join the RStudio Cloud as default**! 

### RStudio Cloud

You will join our workspace on R Studio Cloud. This
enables a **very accessible set-up** for working with R in the cloud
for the less experienced user!

[https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/109060/join?access_code=s3jVNlJn6J8SlZpSXmwvBsCMUC3XicxoFv5kCbCO](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/109060/join?access_code=s3jVNlJn6J8SlZpSXmwvBsCMUC3XicxoFv5kCbCO)

Here are the steps you should take (before the workshop):

- visit the above link
- log in by creating an account for RStudio Cloud or by using your Google or GitHub login credentials
- join the space
- at the top of your screen you see ‘Projects’, click ‘Projects’
- with the ‘copy’ button (on the right) you can make your own version of the ‘Module 3 - Neural Networks’ project; in this copy you can work on the exercises, add comments etc.
- you should now be able to visit the project and see the ‘scripts’ and ‘data’ folders on the right. Open and run the ‘installation-instructions.R’ script from the scripts folder, to see if everything works fine.

We will have everything set up for you in the correct way. You only have to login!

### Local installation

Alternatively, you can bring a laptop with a recent version of R and RStudio installed.
Make sure you can connect your laptop to the internet (or download the
course material one day before the start of the workshop). You will
need:

  - R (at least 3.5.2 <https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>)
  - RStudio
    (<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>)

Please **run the instructions in the below script** (Part 1 and Part 2!) to install the
required packages and Anaconda. 

Make sure to **download the course material** (including scripts and data sets) from the GitHub repo one day before the workshop. Use the green button Code > Download ZIP on the GitHub repo website. As a final step, after downloading, unpack the ZIP folder and make sure you can easily access the material (in particular scripts and data sets).

```{r eval=FALSE}
packages <- c("keras", "tensorflow", "tidyverse", "rstudioapi", "gridExtra", "rsample", "mgcv", "recipes")

# Part 1: install all the needed R packages
new_packages <- packages[!(packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new_packages)) install.packages(new_packages)

if(sum(!(packages %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"]))) {
  stop(paste('The following required packages are not installed:\n', 
             paste(packages[which(!(packages %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"]))], collapse = ', ')));
} else {
  message("All R packages are installed, part 1/2 completed!")
}


# Part 2: install tensorflow and keras

# Download Anaconda from: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

# Perform installation AFTER downloading Anaconda
tensorflow::install_tensorflow(method = 'conda')
keras::install_keras(method = 'conda')

# Run the following set of instructions as a test
# Warning: the first time you run these instructions you may get some warnings/errors
#          then run the instructions a second time and verify if the ' ... part 2/2 completed!' message appears
if(as.array(tensorflow::tf$abs(-10)) == as.array(keras::k_abs(-10))){
  message('Installation of tensorflow and keras went well, part 2/2 completed!')
} else {
  stop('Something went wrong with installation of tensorflow and/or keras')
}
```

These instructions can also be downloaded as .R script from the
`scripts` folder. Open this script in RStudio (via File > Open file),
select the code and press the Run button top right in the script window.
